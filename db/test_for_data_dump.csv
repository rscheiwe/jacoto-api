As data sources proliferate along with the computing power to process them, going straight to the data is one of the most straightforward ways to quickly gain insights and make predictions.  </p>

<p>Machine learning brings together computer science and statistics to harness that predictive power. Itâ€™s a must-have skill for all aspiring data analysts and data scientists, or anyone else who wants to wrestle all that raw data into refined trends and predictions.</p>

<p>This is a class that will teach you the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.

<h3>Lessons 1-4: Supervised Classification</h3>

<p><strong>Naive Bayes:</strong> We jump in headfirst, learning perhaps the worldâ€™s greatest algorithm for classifying text.</p>

<p><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVMs):</strong> One of the top 10 algorithms in machine learning, and a must-try for many classification tasks.  What makes it special?  The ability to generate new features independently and on the fly.</p>

<p><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Extremely straightforward, often just as accurate as an SVM but (usually) way faster.  The launch point for more sophisticated methods, like random forests and boosting.</p>

<h3>Lesson 5: Datasets and Questions</h3>

<p>Behind any great machine learning project is a great dataset that the algorithm can learn from.  We were inspired by a treasure trove of email and financial data from the Enron corporation, which would normally be strictly confidential but became public when the company went bankrupt in a blizzard of fraud.  Follow our lead as we wrestle this dataset into a machine-learning-ready format, in anticipation of trying to predict cases of fraud.</p>

<h3>Lesson 6 and 7: Regressions and Outliers</h3>

<p>Regressions are some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, and rightly share prominence with classification.  Whatâ€™s a fast way to make mistakes in regression, though?  Have troublesome outliers in your data.  Weâ€™ll tackle how to identify and clean away those pesky data points.</p>

<h3>Lesson 8: Unsupervised Learning</h3>

<p><strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> The flagship algorithm when you donâ€™t have labeled data to work with, and a quick method for pattern-searching when approaching a dataset for the first time.</p>

<h3>Lessons 9-12: Features, Features, Features</h3>

<p><strong>Feature Creation:</strong> Taking your human intuition about the world and turning it into data that a computer can use.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Einstein said it best: make everything as simple as possible, and no simpler.  In this case, that means identifying the most important features of your data.</p>

<p><strong>Principal Component Analysis:</strong> A more sophisticated take on feature selection, and one of the crown jewels of unsupervised learning.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Scaling:</strong> Simple tricks for making sure your data and your algorithm play nicely together.<br>
Learning from Text: More information is in text than any other format, and there are some effective but simple tools for extracting that information.</p>

<h3>Lessons 13-14: Validation and Evaluation</h3>

<p><strong>Training/testing data split:</strong> How do you know that what youâ€™re doing is working?  You donâ€™t, unless you validate.  The train-test split is simple to do, and the gold standard for understanding your results.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-validation:</strong> Take the training/testing split and put it on steroids.  Validate your machine learning results like a pro.</p>

<p><strong>Precision, recall, and F1 score:</strong>  After all this data-driven work, quantify your results with metrics tailored to what is most important to you.</p>

<h3>Lesson 15: Wrapping it all Up</h3>

<p>We take a step back and review what weâ€™ve learned, and how it all fits together.  </p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>Mini-project at the end of each lesson</p>

<p>In this intermediate course, Steve Huffman will teach you everything he wished he knew when he started building <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/"" target=""_blank"">Reddit</a> and, more recently, <a href=""http://www.hipmunk.com/"" target=""_blank"">Hipmunk</a>, as a lead engineer. Starting from the basics of how the web works, this course will walk you through core web development concepts such as how internet and browsers fit together, form validations, databases, APIs, integrating with other websites, scaling issues, and more; all of which form part of the knowledge it takes to build a web application of your own.</p>
",web-development--cs253,"<h3>Lesson 1: How the Web Works (2.5 hours)</h3>

<p>In this first lesson, you will learn basic concepts regarding the internet, browsers, HTML, and how all those elements fit together. Youâ€™ll start using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to format content for webpages. Then youâ€™ll get to see the mechanics of how the web works: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) via GET and POST requests. In the first problem set, you will get a simple website up and running with the Google App Engine platform. </p>

<h3>Lesson 2: Forms and Input (4 hours)</h3>

<p>In this second lesson you will learn about forms, a very common way to obtain input from users. You will learn how to get and process user input from webpages using Google App Engine to get a live form up and running. By the end of this lesson, you will know how to validate user input and securely obtain data from users.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3: Databases (6 hours)</h3>

<p>You learned about getting all sorts of information from users in the previous lesson, but what do you do with it once itâ€™s in your hands? You store it! In this third lesson, Steve will dive in and teach you what you need to know about databases, the final piece you need to start setting your blog in motion! You will learn about various database technologies, SQL, and the Google App Engine Datastore.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4: User Accounts and Security (6 hours)</h3>

<p>In this fourth lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of authentication and security, which are very relevant topics in almost any web application built today. Weâ€™ll start by examining how websites use cookies to authenticate users and how we can manage cookies from the backend of a web application. You will implement a login system for your blog and learn how to use hashing to securely read and transmit user passwords.</p>

<h3>Lesson 5: APIs (4.5 hours)</h3>

<p>Up until now, your programs have generated HTML that a browser can use to render a web page for the user. In the digital world, however, applications and websites communicate not only with people, but also with other applications and websites. By the end of this lesson, your blog will communicate with humans as well as with other computers. Your web application can generate data in formats such as XML and JSON that other computers can access through an API, or application programming interface. Those computers, in turn, can build websites or services that interact with your data. Youâ€™ll first learn how to use APIs, and then build web applications as services so that other computers can glean data from your application. We will look at both XML and JSON by investigating how to read them, how to interpret them, and how to manipulate them. </p>

<h3>Lesson 6: Caching (3.5 hours)</h3>

<p>In this lesson, we will explore how to prepare your applications to run at a large scale. So far, we&#39;ve written &#39;toy&#39; applications for just one or two users. If we want to start writing apps for thousands or, perhaps, even millions of users, then obviously we&#39;ll need to think about scaling. When we talk about scaling, this may mean running your application on multiple machines, storing huge amounts of data, or consuming large amounts of bandwidth. In particular, we will learn about caching, including the uses of caching, why you might want to cache, and specific caching implementations such as Memcached. </p>

<h3>Lesson 7: Scaling Up (2.5 hours)</h3>

<p>In this last lesson of the course, Steve has prepared a relaxing, story-time segment. You will hear web development anecdotes from people who have been through it all. You will enjoy interviews with engineer Neil Williams from Reddit, and engineer Chris Chew from Udacity. They will share their experiences on working with web applications, and you will see how all that youâ€™ve learned in this course comes into the big picture.</p>

<h3>Final Project (8 hours)</h3>

<p>For the final project, you will build a fully functional wiki - a website that allows any page to be edited. The wiki you will be able to build by the end of the course will feature the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Easily create new pages of the site by using the wiki edit capabilities. You should be able to enter a non-existent URL, redirect to an edit page, and create a new page from there. </li>
<li>Have user accounts so that logged-in users only will have edit privileges. </li>
<li>Use caching functionality.</li>

<p>You will learn about challenges of building applications that can serve hundreds of thousands of users, and how you can prepare for them as a developer. And more importantly - you will learn how to harness the power of <strong>App Engine</strong> - Platform as a Service, run by Google, so you can focus on your application&#39;s features, not on managing infrastructure that runs your app. Let Google run and scale the infrastructure and do what you do best - write code! </p>

<p>However, to use App Engine effectively, you have to learn how it works, and this is exactly what this course will teach! You will also learn the best practices of using <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-endpoints/"" target=""_blank"">Cloud Endpoints</a> that allow you to easily create API services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients. They allow you to automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy.

This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.</p>

<p>This course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. â€œScaleâ€ù really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way youâ€™ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques youâ€™ll need to do so.</p>

<p>The techniques youâ€™ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques youâ€™ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice. (Programming models youâ€™ll use include Cilk Plus, OpenMP, and MPI, and possibly others.)</p>
",high-performance-computing--ud281,"<p>The course topics are centered on three different ideas or extensions to the usual serial RAM model you encounter in CS 101. Recall that a serial RAM assumes a sequential or serial processor connected to a main memory.</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit 1: The work-span or dynamic multithreading model</li>
</ul>

<p>In this model, the idea is that there are multiple processors connected to the main memory. Since they can all â€œseeâ€ù the same memory, the processors can coordinate and communicate via reads and writes to that â€œsharedâ€ù memory.</p>

<p>Sub-topics include:</p>

<p>** Intro to the basic algorithmic model<br>
** Intro to OpenMP, a practical programming model<br>
** Comparison-based sorting algorithms<br>
** Scans and linked list algorithms<br>
** Tree algorithms<br>
** Graph algorithms, e.g., breadth-first search</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit 2: Distributed memory or network models</li>
</ul>

<p>In this model, the idea is that there is not one serial RAM, but many serial RAMs connected by a network. In this model, each serial RAMâ€™s memory is private to the other RAMs; consequently, the processors must coordinate and communicate by sending and receiving messages.</p>

<p>Sub-topics include:</p>

<p>** The basic algorithmic model<br>
** Intro to the Message Passing Interface, a practical programming model<br>
** Reasoning about the effects of network topology<br>
** Dense linear algebra<br>
** Sorting<br>
** Sparse graph algorithms<br>
** Graph partitioning</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit 3: Two-level memory or I/O models</li>
</ul>

<p>In this model, we return to a serial RAM, but instead of having only a processor connected to a main memory, there is a smaller but faster scratchpad memory in between the two. The algorithmic question here is how to use the scratchpad effectively, in order to minimize costly data transfers from main memory.</p>

<p>Sub-topics include:</p>

<p>** Basic models<br>
** Efficiency metrics, including â€œemergingâ€ù metrics like energy and power<br>
** I/O-aware algorithms<br>
** Cache-oblivious algorithms</p>

",object-oriented-javascript--ud015,"<h3>Lesson 1: Scopes and Closures</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ll start by discussing JavaScriptâ€™s functional variable scoping features, including lexical scopes (variable availability as you write your code) and dynamics scopes (variable availability as your code actively runs). Weâ€™ll then discuss closures, an often misunderstood but incredibly useful feature available in only a handful of languages, including JavaScript.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2: The Keyword â€œthisâ€ù</h3>

<p>Youâ€™ll start your dive into JavaScript object-oriented features by first discovering the parameter â€œthisâ€ù. Youâ€™ll learn how the value of â€œthisâ€ù is determined within various code structures and why it might be a lot easier to think of â€œthisâ€ù as a parameter rather than a keyword.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3: Prototype Delegation</h3>

<p>Youâ€™re probably using one of JavaScriptâ€™s inheritance models already: prototype delegation! In this lesson youâ€™ll learn more about this unique feature of JavaScript, how JavaScript uses this feature internally and how you can take advantage of it to maximize your applicationâ€™s memory footprint.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4: Code Reuse</h3>

<p>There are numerous ways to write concise, maintainable and reusable code in JavaScript and youâ€™ll practice a number of them in this lesson. Weâ€™ll start writing a library using basic functions and learn the decorator pattern. Then, weâ€™ll refactor this library into the functional, prototypal and pseudoclassical inheritance models. Finally, weâ€™ll explore sub-classing -- coding objects that directly inherit from objects weâ€™ve previously defined.</p>

Though this is a very specific app use case, the skills you learn will be applicable to just about any business app youâ€™d want to develop.</p>
",intro-to-point-click-app-development--ud162,"<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In this class youâ€™ll learn the basics of building apps with Force.com, a part of Salesforce Platform. These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldnâ€™t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!).</p>

<p>There are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But donâ€™t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. </p>

<p>This class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you&#39;ll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you&#39;ll put everything together.</p>

<h3>Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins)</h3>

<p>What <strong>is</strong> Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it?</p>

<p>In this lesson, youâ€™ll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. </p>

<h3>Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes)</h3>

<p>In this lesson youâ€™ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. Youâ€™ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, youâ€™ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, youâ€™ll learn about:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Salesforce Data</strong>: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. Youâ€™ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. </li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson youâ€™ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. </li>
<li><strong>Validation Rules</strong>: If youâ€™ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to build them into your app. </li>
<li><strong>Formulas and Summaries</strong>: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson youâ€™ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app.<br></li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins)</h3>

<p>Behind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson youâ€™ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which youâ€™ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>One-to-Many Relationships</strong>: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson youâ€™ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. </li>
<li><strong>Many-to-Many Relationships</strong>: Youâ€™ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. </li>
<li><strong>Customizing the User Interface</strong>: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson youâ€™ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.</li>
<li><strong>Schema Builder</strong>: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson youâ€™ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.</li>
<li><strong>Data Loading</strong>: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins)</h3>

<p>No matter what kind of app youâ€™re building, youâ€™ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson youâ€™ll learn how quickly communicate information with  real-time data visualizations. Specifically, youâ€™ll learn how to make:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reports</strong>: These let you gather related information into one place.  These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. </li>
<li><strong>Charts</strong>: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards</strong>: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Views</strong>: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins)</h3>

<p>In this lesson youâ€™ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. Youâ€™ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Workflows</strong>: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.</li>
<li><strong>Approval Processes</strong>: You donâ€™t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say â€œthis looks good.â€ù Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins)</h3>

<p>This is it. With a few clicks of the mouse youâ€™ll make your app social and mobile. The tools youâ€™ll use are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Chatter</strong>: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together.<br></li>
<li><strong>Salesforce1</strong>: That web app youâ€™ve been building this whole time? Itâ€™s actually a mobile app too. Youâ€™ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours)</h3>

<p>By the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now itâ€™s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.</p>
","[{'key': 'salesforce', 'name': 'Salesforce', 'image': 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-content/partner/logo-color-salesforce-0cbe067.svg'}]",[],[],beginner,UdacityAndroid Basics: Data Storage,https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-content/course/images/ud845-8246c39.jpg,"<p>In this course, you will learn about the importance of data persistence when building an Android app. We&#39;ll introduce you to the fundamentals of SQL, the programming language needed to interact with an SQLite relational database.

You could implement web security and permissions on your own, but relying on trusted providers is a faster, safer, and easier way to allow users to login to your application - without having to create and maintain another account, profile, and password. </p>

<p>In this course, you will learn to implement the OAuth 2.0 framework to allow users to securely login to your web applications. You&#39;ll be provided a  <a href=""http://udacity-oauth.herokuapp.com"" target=""_blank"">restaurant menu application</a> created in Flask. By the end of this course, you will write the necessary code to implement Google+ Sign-In and Facebook Login in options so users can create restaurant menus that are viewable by everyone but only modifiable by the original creator.</p>
",authentication-authorization-oauth--ud330,"<h3>Lesson 1 - Authentication vs. Authorization</h3>

<p>Learn the difference between the concepts of authentication and authorization and address some major security concerns that developers must protect against when developing a web application.  You will learn how OAuth 2.0 makes implementing security easier for developers and users alike by allowing your users to sign in to your applications while keeping all of the security on well-known and trusted OAuth providers. Finally, you will see OAuth 2.0 in action as you make API requests using Google&#39;s OAuth 2.0 Playground.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2 - Creating a Google+ Sign-In</h3>

<p>Learn about the different types of security flows your application can implement. You will see how security can be handled by your server, your user&#39;s browser, or both depending on the type of security your application needs.  You will then add a Google+ Sign-In to an existing web application and implement a hybridized client/server flow.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3 - Local Permission Systems</h3>

<p>Add python code to create server-side rules that will constitute a permission system. This system will limit access of the database for each logged in user based on how the developer designs this code. You will add a User model model to your database to store the credentials, such as username, email, and profile picture, collected from the OAuth provider&#39;s API.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4 - Adding Facebook &amp; Other Providers</h3>

<p>Learn to implement multiple OAuth providers on your web application. You will add Facebook Login as an alternative sign in option for your users and understand how to use OAuth provider documentation to add as many providers as you see fit for your application.</p>

The first one is an overview of responsive design and introduces the way youâ€™ll need to shift your thinking as you go from desktop first design, to responsive design.  Lessons 2, 3, 4 and 5 will cover the important theoretical concepts of responsive design, and include plenty of hands-on exercises implementing what youâ€™ve learned.  </p>

<h3>Lesson 1 - Why Responsive?</h3>

<p>What is responsive web design and why is it important? What kinds of devices should we be targeting with our design? How can we best leverage the different capabilities of each device to provide great experiences to users? Youâ€™ll also make sure that your development environment is ready to go. </p>

<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What is responsive design?</li>
<li>Why does responsive design work for any device?</li>
<li>Remote debugging and emulation in the browser</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson 2 - Starting Small</h3>

<p>The best way to get started is to start small and build up. In this lesson, weâ€™ll cover the key components that make a site great on a small screen, including setting the viewport, adding content and sizing the content to the viewport.  Youâ€™ll start the home town site project, by making sure that it looks good on a small screen.  </p>

<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Why start small and build up?</li>
<li>What is the viewport?</li>
<li>Sizing the content to the viewport

<ul>
<li>avoiding static sized items</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Touch targets, and why they should be large</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson 3 - Building Up</h3>

<p>Once youâ€™ve got a page optimized for small screens, itâ€™s time to start thinking about how theyâ€™ll look on larger screens.  Learn how to use CSS media queries to add breakpoints that change the layout depending on the screen size or other device characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CSS media queries</li>
<li>What is a breakpoint, and how to choose one</li>
<li>Using the CSS flexbox to modify layout</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson 4 - Common Responsive Patterns</h3>

<p>Now that youâ€™ve got the basics of responsive design down, youâ€™ll learn about and practice some of the common layout design patterns used across sites. You&#39;ll also iterate on the home town site project, creating breakpoints for tablet and desktop layouts using the patterns from this lesson.</p>

<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Mostly fluid pattern</li>

<li>Layout shifter pattern</li>
<li>Off canvas pattern</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson 5 - Optimizations</h3>

<p>Learn strategies for minor breakpoints used to adjust the margins or padding on an element, or increase the font size to make it feel more natural in the layout. Youâ€™ll also learn about strategies for dealing with tables and optimal text readability. At the end of the lesson, you&#39;ll iterate for the last time on the home town site, adding minor breakpoints to really make the experience stand out.</p>

<p>In this course you will learn how to work with images on the modern web, so that your images look great and load quickly on any device.</p>

<p>Along the way, you will pick up a range of skills and techniques to smoothly integrate responsive images into your development workflow. By the end of the course, you will be developing with images that adapt and respond to different viewport sizes and usage scenarios.</p>
",responsive-images--ud882,"<h3>Lesson 1 - Getting up and Running</h3>

<p>Before you start working with responsive images, you need to start debugging on your mobile devices. This lesson will help you get started with Developer Tools and mobile debugging.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2 - Units, Formats, Environments</h3>

<p>You can&#39;t optimize what you can&#39;t measure. In this lesson, you will start with comparing different kinds of images on the web and getting familiar with different units you can use to scale them.</p>

<p>You will also get a chance to set up your development environment so that responsive images become a painless part of your workflow.</p>

<p>At the end of the lesson, you will start working on the responsive blog project, where you have a chance to apply responsive image principles in a real-world scenario!</p>

<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sizing Images</li>
<li>File Types</li>
<li>Automation Tools</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lesson 3 - Images with Markup</h3>

<p>Not all graphics need to be .JPGs or .PNGs. This lesson dives into using markup techniques like CSS and icon fonts to create responsive graphics. While markup techniques are awesome because they are natively responsive, they are often <strong>extremely</strong> lightweight, requiring a fraction of the bytes of traditional images!</p>

<p>At the end of the lesson, you will replace extraneous images with markup techniques and take advantage of font icons to add social media icons to the responsive blog project!</p>

<p><strong>Topics covered:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CSS Techniques</li>
<li>Inlining Images</li>
<li>Unicode</li>

Then, we&#39;ll discuss a paradigm that will help us in the future, and weâ€™ll see some examples of that paradigm in action.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2: Refactoring</h3>

<p>We&#39;ll spend some time discussing how our new paradigm applies to the project we worked on in Lesson 1. Then we&#39;ll rebuild the project with the new organizational paradigm.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3: Using an Organizational Library</h3>

<p>We&#39;ll explore how to use KnockoutJS, an organizational library, to organize our code and to reduce the amount of boilerplate code we write. Our resulting application will be well-organized, easy to understand, and extendable.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4: Exploring Unfamiliar Code</h3>

<p>In this final lesson, we&#39;ll spend some time talking about how to explore code that you didn&#39;t write, possibly even using a library or framework that you aren&#39;t familiar with.

Two versions of the website are shown to different users - usually the existing website and a potential change. Then, the results are analyzed to determine whether the change is an improvement worth launching. This course will cover how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical power, how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions, and how to ensure that the the participants of your experiments are adequately protected.</p>
",ab-testing--ud257,"<h3>Lesson 1: Overview of A/B Testing</h3>

<p>This lesson will cover what A/B testing is and what it can be used for.

This includes how to choose which users will be in your experiment and control group - different online definitions of a &quot;user&quot;, and what effects different choices will have on your experiment. It will also cover when to  limit your experiment to a subset of your entire user base, how to calculate how many events you will need in order to draw strong conclusions from your results, and how this translates into how long to run the experiment. Finally, the lesson will cover how various design decisions affect the size of your experiment, so you will know which decisions to revisit if you need results more quickly.</p>

<h3>Lesson 5: Analyzing Results</h3>

<p>This lesson will cover how to analyze the results of your experiments. Step one is always to run some sanity checks so that you can catch problems with your experiment set-up. Then, you will learn how to check conclusions with multiple methods, including a hypothesis test on the effect size and a binomial sign test, if you get results that surprise you. You will also learn how measuring multiple metrics for the same experiment can make analysis difficult, and some techniques for handling multiple metrics. Finally, you will learn about several analysis &quot;gotchas&quot;, and what to do if you see them, including how Simpson&#39;s Paradox can affect A/B tests, and why even statistically significant results might disappear when you launch.</p>

And more importantly - you will learn how to harness the power of <strong>App Engine</strong> - Platform as a Service, run by Google, so you can focus on your application&#39;s features, not on managing infrastructure that runs your app. Let Google run and scale the infrastructure and do what you do best - write code! </p>

<p>However, to use App Engine effectively, you have to learn how it works, and this is exactly what this course will teach! You will also learn the best practices of using <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-endpoints/"" target=""_blank"">Cloud Endpoints</a> that allow you to easily create RESTful services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients. They allow you to automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy. And there are some nifty built-in features, like denial-of-service protection and OAuth 2.0 support.</p>
",developing-scalable-apps-in-java--ud859,"<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This course consists of 6 lessons. First one is an overview of cloud computing and the benefits of Platform as a Service. Lessons 2-5 will cover important theoretical concepts of Google App Engine and also plenty of hands-on exercises implementing what you have learned. Lesson 6 will be a short intro on an easy way to create native mobile apps that talk to your backend.</p>

<h3>Lesson 1: Scalability Basics</h3>

<p>Do you know how and why server racks were invented years ago? Have you realized all of the problems that you have to solve if you will try to scale your app by yourself? Learn about a better way.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2: Getting Started</h3>

<p>Set up your first App Engine project and learn how to define Cloud Endpoints. </p>

<p>Start the course project app - Conference Central and add authentication and user profiles.</p>

<h3>Lesson 3: Storing and Retrieving Data</h3>

<p>One of the most important things you want to do in your app is storing data. In this lesson you will learn what is Google App Engine Datastore, how is it different from RDBMS and how you can use it in your applications.</p>

<p>Add the ability to store and retrieve user profiles and conferences to the course project app.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4: Advanced Datastore Concepts</h3>

<p>Learn more about how Datastore works, including queries, filters, indexes and transactions. </p>

<p>Add different ways to query conferences.</p>

<h3>Lesson 5: Advanced App Engine Topics</h3>

<p>There are a lot of things you might want your application to do in background, without making the user wait, or even initiate the process. Learn about task queues and cron jobs and how you can use them to add advanced functionality to your app. You will also learn about Memcache, and get an overview of topics like Edge Caching, AppStats and other methods of optimising your apps performance.</p>

<p>Add a push queue, cron job and a customised Memcache entry to your app.</p>

<h3>Lesson 6: App Engine and Mobile Apps</h3>

<p>You have been using Cloud Endpoints in the app, and now itâ€™s time to see how you can use them in a mobile app. Learn how to generate native libraries for Android and iOS that can talk to your backend. You can even recompile the Android app we provide with our course, to work against your own project. How cool is that?</p>

But monetization should be built into the fabric of a game from the beginning, because a clearly defined and understood monetization strategy can have tremendous impact on design decisions made during the development process. This kind of forward-thinking approach is especially important in todayâ€™s highly competitive game market, and keeping monetization strategy front-of-mind throughout can be the difference between product success and failure. </p>

<p>This course will teach you how to make your game stand out in a very crowded field, and encourage people to pay for game features that will define the ultimate success of your product.</p>

<p>Currently, most game apps are free to play, and many users are looking for something simple and entertaining without the risk of making a purchase. We&#39;ll look at the most successful premium and freemium games, and discuss the most effective strategies for monetization. Our goal in this course is to teach students how to design games that produce sustainable revenue over the long-term.</p>
",engagement-monetization-mobile-games--ud407,"<h2>Lesson 1</h2>

<h3>Engagement</h3>

<p>Students will learn the best design strategies to keep players interested and engaged, and come to understand what it takes to build an appealingly addictive game. We&#39;ll talk about designing game  difficulty, and including competition and social networks to get players more involved in your game. Inspiring genuine engagement is critical for a game to produce revenue in the long-term.</p>

<h2>Lesson 2</h2>

<h3>Monetization Models</h3>

<p>We&#39;ll discuss monetization strategies for both premium gamesâ€”which cost a set price to downloadâ€”and free-to-download â€œfreemiumâ€ù games which rely on things like ads and in-app purchases to generate revenue. Topics will include a comparison of both premium and freemium models, how to make a profit from them, and how to effectively implement ads and in-app purchases.</p>

<h2>Lesson 3</h2>

<h3>Best Publishing Practices</h3>

<p>Here weâ€™ll look at the final steps youâ€™ll want to take before submitting your game to the app store. This lesson will cover how to get useful player feedback, and how to test out versions of your game with A/B testing. We&#39;ll also discuss design strategies for choosing what will appear in the app storeâ€”like icons and screenshotsâ€”so that your game is appealing to potential players, stands out against the competition, and encourages shoppers to become customers.</p>

After this stage you will have incredible power: you will be able to automate almost any repetitive task that can be done on a computer. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will <em>write a program in Python to build a reverse Mad Libs game.</em></p>

<h3>Stage 3: Create a Movie Website</h3>

<p>In this stage, you will learn an entirely new approach to programming (and thinking) called Object Oriented Programming and how to use this approach to build impressive programs by simply reusing or modifying computer code that others have already written. In the <strong>project checkpoint</strong> you will create a simple movies webpage with images and trailers.*</p>

<h3>Stage 4: Discover Your Path</h3>

<p>In this stage, you&#39;ll be taking apart the Project Compass web app and examining the features that different types of developers contribute. With a solid understanding of these different roles, you will be ready to choose one to dive into in the next stage. <em>In this *</em>checkpoint*<em>, you will have an opportunity to reflect on which type of developer you are most interested in exploring in the next stage, and then discuss your plans with your peers.</em></p>

<h3>Lesson 09: Input</h3>

<p>Using a keyboard on mobile is awful. Weâ€™ll discuss ways to improve it, using semantic input for form data, and other user input options on mobile.</p>

<h3>Lesson 10: Device Access</h3>

<p>Mobile devices have a full array of sensors typically unavailable on desktop. Weâ€™ll talk about camera access, geolocation, and other sensors and feedback you have access to on mobile.</p>

<h3>Lesson 11: Offline and Storage</h3>

<p>Itâ€™s an unfortunate reality that mobile users arenâ€™t always online. Weâ€™ll go over using the local cache as well as local storage APIs to give your users a great offline (and partially-online) experience as well.</p>

<h3>Lesson 12: Wrap-up</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ll finish up the class by talking briefly about other topics to consider, such as app experience, monetization, deployment and distribution. Weâ€™ll also point you to other resources to look at moving forward in your career.</p>

<p>This is a survey course designed to provide a broad, forward-facing overview of contemporary health informatics, a specialized field of computing that seeks to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. To understand health informatics (HIT) you also need to have at least a basic understanding of the complex and highly regulated US healthcare industry. The course is designed for students from diverse backgrounds and who have not been previously exposed to HIT. It is divided into three sections:</p>

<p>The US healthcare delivery and the key role of the federal government in promoting HIT adoption</p>

<p>The core technologies that drive all contemporary HIT systems and tools</p>

<p>The real world applications of HIT from electronic medical and personal health records to exploiting digital data aggregated from them for research and other purposes</p>
",health-informatics-in-the-cloud--ud809,"<h3>Lesson 1: The US Healthcare System</h3>

<p>This lesson will discuss unique and the complex nature of the US healthcare system: its key problems, the specific challenges presented by chronic disease, the major disconnect between the health systemâ€™s capabilities and the demands of chronic disease management, and the hope that a combination of new incentives, health IT adoption, and new models of care can bridge this disconnect leading to a more efficient, effective, safer and more patient-centered US system of care.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2: Federal Policies &amp; Initiatives</h3>

<p>This lesson will focus on the important details of the specific programs that the federal government has put into place to spur health IT adoption by eligible providers and hospitals as well as the role played by financial incentives that reward performance, rather than the quantity of procedures. </p>

<h3>Lesson 3: Health Information Exchange</h3>

<p>This lesson will focus on the rationale for and the major challenges of health information exchange (HIE). We will discuss the various ways of classifying HIE, how to differentiate the various HIE architectures, and the Indiana Health Information Exchange as a premier example including descriptions of its key services. We will discuss new approaches and technologies with a particular emphasis on Direct HIE, a new technology based on secure email and encrypted attachments.</p>

<h3>Lesson 4: Privacy, Security and Trust</h3>

<p>This lesson focuses on the keys issues of privacy, security, and trust in a world of digital records and health information exchange. Students will understand the key role that patient engagement plays in chronic disease prevention and management and the concerns patients have about sharing their health data. They will also explore the various privacy consent models. Data segmentation will be discussed as a key challenge for obtaining patient consent under what may be the most acceptable model. The concept of public key infrastructure (PKI) including the roles of the public key, private key, registration authority and certificate authority will be covered.</p>

<h3>Lesson 5A: Data Standards</h3>

<p>We divide the discussion of standards into those for health data and those for achieving its sharing by fostering interoperability. This lesson  focuses on data standards after reviewing the rationale for standards and the evolutions that have been taking place in their use, technology and structure. Students will be able to recognize the difference between a classification and an ontology.  They will be familiar with the key data standards (including ICD, CPT, LOINC and SNOMED). They will also gain an overview of the differences between standards based on EDI/X12 and XML.</p>

<h3>Lesson 5B: Interoperability Standards</h3>

<p>This lesson builds on Lesson 5A on data standards to show how these data are transmitted within messages using HL7 and packaged into CCDA-based clinical documents for sharing via HIE. Weâ€™ll briefly introduce even more advanced standards with a particular emphasis on clinical decision support (CDS, an important technology for the future) and the key elements of and remaining challenges with standards to support CDS. Weâ€™ll also discuss more facile next generation approaches based on web technologies and approaches. </p>

<h3>Lesson 6: Clinical Data Collection and Visualization Challenges</h3>

<p>Students should understand the key roles that data plays in medical practice and the root causes of common data quality issues in general and the specific root causes of data quality issues with respect to electronic health records. They should understand the high level challenges of efficiently and accurately collecting high quality, comprehensive clinical data from physicians and of visualizing digital health data in a way that supports the providerâ€™s mental model. They should understand the key roles that information technology plays in the future vision of healthcare.</p>

<h3>Lesson 7: Empowering the Patient</h3>

<p>Students should understand the key role that support for patients can play so they can achieve behavior change, adhere to their prescribed treatments and generate data to help their providers more continuously manage their chronic diseases. They should understand patient interests. They should understand the key information technology tools now available to patients including patient health records, portals, social networking, in home technologies and mobile devices and sensors. They should have a detailed functional understanding of personal health records and their potential as app platforms. They should understand the potential role of social networking in patient education and care management. They should understand the various telemedicine modalities being developed and offered for use by patients at home.</p>

<h3>Lesson 8: Population Health Management</h3>

<p>Students should understand the difference between individual patient management, population management and public health. They should understand the technologies for aggregating data, the kinds of data that are collected and the kinds of reports that are required for population and public health management.</p>

<h3>Lesson 9: Data Query in a Federated Environment</h3>

<p>Students should understand the challenges of data query and aggregation in an environment where care providers are using disparate and non-interoperable EHRs. They should be familiar with and understand the differences among the distributed query technologies. They should be familiar with the distributed query standards and the various open source query frameworks reviewed in this lesson.</p>

<h3>Lesson 10: Big Data Meets Healthcare</h3>

<p>Students should understand the concept of â€œbig dataâ€ù; the common technical approaches to modeling and simulation and the common applications of each. They should be familiar with the specific case studies of analytic applications to healthcare problems as diverse as improved clinical decision support, understanding clinical processes, modeling care spaces and providing optimal patient-specific treatments.</p>

<p>In SDP, you will learn how to select and implement the ideal software process for your development project. Through Professor Orso&#39;s engaging examples and interviews with industry insiders, you will learn both conceptual and practical aspects of software engineering. The course covers requirements engineering, architecture and design, testing and maintenance, and software quality in general. </p>

<p>The goal of this class is to equip you with the skills necessary to define requirements, set up an integrated development environment (IDE), learn Git (and Github!) and use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to design and build an Android application. We will also examine several testing practices and refactoring techniques that are helpful before the launch of your software project. </p>

<p>While everyone working with software should have these skills, they are particularly important for Software Engineers and Engineering Managers.</p>

<p>This class is simultaneously an introductory course about educational technology and an advanced, project-oriented class on designing or researching technology&#39;s intersection with education. As such, the course provides information about a large number of topics within educational technology, including pedagogical strategies, research methodologies, current tools, open problems, and broader issues. The scope of the material provided goes beyond what any one person could reasonably learn in a semester. Instead, you will select those areas that appeal to you or that support your ultimate project ideas. For example, if you&#39;re interested in research, you may focus on the applicable research methodologies to your chosen area of investigation, relevant pedagogical strategies or theories, and the current state-of-the-art within that community.  If you&#39;re interested in design, you may focus on the relevant pedagogical strategies or theories for your chosen domain, the current popular tools within that domain, and open problems that need to be addressed.</p>
",educational-technology--ud915,"<p>A learning goal is what you should know by the end of the class. The broad learning goal for this class is that, by the end of the class, you will have the requisite knowledge to make a real contribution to the Educational Technology field.</p>

<p>Even established experts in the field do not know everything, however, and neither will you. Instead, by the end of this class, you will have sufficient knowledge to contribute to the field in some way, though not every way. This means the learning goal of the class is determined in part by your own goals in taking this class:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you interested in understanding how technology can help education more theoretically? Then your learning goals would include knowledge of research methodologies, promising pedagogical strategies, and current theories in the community.</li>
<li>Are you interested in designing technologies that can help learners learn better? Then your learning goals would include knowledge of pedagogical strategies, current state-of-the-art tools, and the open problems in education and technology.</li>
<li>Are you interested in evaluating existing technologies? Then your learning goals would include knowledge of research methodologies in user testing, current state-of-the-art tools, and broader issues surrounding the impact of such tools.</li>
<li>Are you interested in contributing to the education enterprise more broadly, even if it isn&#39;t at the point of learning? Then your learning goals would include knowledge of the current problems in the field, broader issues surrounding the use of tools in supporting education, and the present tools that address those problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>By achieving these learning goals, you will end the class with the knowledge necessary to contribute to the portion of educational technology in which you are most interested.</p>

Machine learning happens to be a small part of this process. The model building process involves setting up ways of collecting data, understanding and paying attention to what is important in the data to answer the questions you are asking, finding a statistical, mathematical or a simulation model to gain understanding and make predictions. </p>

<p>All of these things are equally important and model building is a crucial skill to acquire in every field of science. The process stays true to the scientific method, making what you learn through your models useful for gaining an understanding of whatever you are investigating as well as make predictions that hold true to test. </p>

<p>In this short course, youâ€™ll learn about the Critical Rendering Path, or the set of steps browsers must take to convert HTML, CSS and JavaScript into living, breathing websites. From there, youâ€™ll start exploring and experimenting with tools to measure performance and simple strategies to deliver the first pixels to the screen as early as possible. Youâ€™ll learn how to dive into recommendations from <a href=""https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"" title=""PageSpeed Insights"">PageSpeed Insights</a> and the Timeline view of Google Chromeâ€™s Developer Tools to find the data you need to achieve immediate performance boosts!</p>

<p>Throughout the course, youâ€™ll build a performance toolbox to help you build faster website experiences by taking advantage of PageSpeed Insights recommendations and measuring page performance on mobile and desktop with Chrome Developer Tools.</p>

<p>This class contains an introductory lesson, two primary lessons and a final project. Before diving into optimizations, youâ€™ll build an understanding of how browsers convert HTML, CSS and JavaScript into websites. Along the way, youâ€™ll practice measuring performance using the same tools Google engineers use.</p>

<p>Then comes the really fun part: optimization! Youâ€™ll learn about easy-to-implement performance gains and develop a simple and powerful model for uncovering optimization opportunities.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll put your newfound performance skillset to the test with the final project, where youâ€™ll be optimizing your own online portfolio website!</p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<h3>Lesson 0 (20 minutes)</h3>

<p>You canâ€™t optimize what you canâ€™t measure, so in this lesson youâ€™ll learn how to open Chrome Developer Tools to measure the performance of mobile and desktop websites.</p>

<h3>Lesson 1 (60 minutes)</h3>

<p>Optimizing any websiteâ€™s performance requires a strong understanding of how browsers build websites from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Youâ€™ll start by breaking down the <strong>Critical Rendering Path</strong> - the steps the browser has to take to render a page. Youâ€™ll get an understanding of how:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> is converted to the <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong> is converted to the <strong>CSS Object Model (CSSOM)</strong>.</li>
<li>the browser runs <strong>layout</strong> to determine the position and size of elements before <strong>painting</strong> pixels on the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to take advantage of the Timeline view in <strong>Chrome Developer Tools</strong> to measure each and every stepâ€™s performance on mobile and desktop.</p>

<h3>Lesson 2 (90 minutes)</h3>

<p>Youâ€™ll explore easy HTML, CSS and JavaScript optimizations with significant performance implications, some of which are as simple as adding a single attribute to an HTML tag! Along the way, youâ€™ll be developing the skills to help you diagnose opportunities for optimizations, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>building <strong>quick and dirty</strong> diagrams of the Critical Rendering Path.</li>
<li>identifying <strong>three key metrics</strong> to triangulate potential performance bottlenecks.</li>

Youâ€™ll understand when and why users need accessibility. Then youâ€™ll dive into the â€œhowâ€ù: making a page work properly with screen readers, and managing input focus (e.g. the highlight you see when tabbing through a form.) Youâ€™ll understand what â€œsemanticsâ€ù and â€œsemantic markupâ€ù mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable navigating the interface with a range of assistive devices. Finally, youâ€™ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate your pages easily and reliably.</p>

<p>This course is also featured in our <a href=""/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004"">Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree</a> program.</p>
",web-accessibility--ud891,"<h2>Lesson 1: Overview</h2>

<p>In this lesson youâ€™ll learn why accessibility matters, and who it affects. Youâ€™ll also get a first look at the web accessibility guidelines (WAI â€“ Web Accessibility Initiative), understand what â€œPOURâ€ù means for accessibility, and locate checklists to help make your own sites accessible.</p>

<h2>Lesson 2: Focus</h2>

<p>In this lesson youâ€™ll learn how to make a page usable for anyone navigating with the keyboard. This starts with an introduction to the concept of focus (the element on the page to which keyboard events will be targeted), how to make elements focusable and when, and the order in which focusable elements will be traversed when exploring the page with the keyboard. Youâ€™ll also learn how to manage focus in forms, in custom components, pop-ups, and off-screen content. </p>

<h2>Lesson 3: Semantics Basics</h2>

<p>In this lesson youâ€™ll build on keyboard navigation to make a page work for people who are unable to use a standard user interface, including users who can&#39;t see the screen. This requires ensuring assistive technology (such as screen readers) has sufficient information to present an alternative UI. Youâ€™ll use a screen reader to try out ordinary form elements and add markup to make them work even better. Youâ€™ll understand the accessibility tree the browser constructs from the DOM. Finally, youâ€™ll learn how to built-in HTML features to ensure the accessibility tree accurately reflects the visual UI. </p>

<h2>Lesson 4: Semantics Extras</h2>

<p>In this lesson, youâ€™ll dive deeper into the screen-reader experience to add hyper-fast navigation. Youâ€™ll learn how to arrange headings and label links so screen reader users can fly through your pages! Youâ€™ll also learn how to call out â€œlandmarksâ€ù into your page to speed up navigation even more. (As a bonus, this â€œsemantic markupâ€ù  also makes your markup more readable!)</p>

<h2>Lesson 5: Semantics - ARIA</h2>

<p>In this lesson, youâ€™ll move beyond the native elements of HTML into building custom controls and interactions. Of course you want these to be accessible, and thatâ€™s where ARIA comes in â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications. Youâ€™ll learn how to add attributes to your custom interactions to make them as accessible as native elements. Youâ€™ll also learn how to manage these attributes from Javascript as the user interacts with your page.</p>

<h2>Lesson 6: Style</h2>

<p>In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn the third pillar of Accessibility (after Focus and Semantics): Styling. Your pageâ€™s styles need to support highlighting the focus, indicating ARIA states, being zoomed in or out, and viewed by people with limited color or contrast vision. Youâ€™ll learn how to audit your page with the Chrome Accessibility Tools and correct any styling issues that pop up, as well as designing with accessibility in mind.</p>
